#Decentralized Insurance Pool

## Project Description
A basic decentralized insurance model where users can contribute STX into a shared pool and submit claims. Admins can review and approve claims, and payouts are made from the pooled funds.

## Project Vision
To build a trustless mutual insurance platform where claim approvals are governed by smart contracts and community votes instead of centralized entities.

## Future Scope
- Add DAO governance for claim approvals
- Implement risk scoring and premiums
- Enable automatic claim verification via oracles (e.g., for flight insurance or weather-based coverage)
